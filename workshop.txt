title=[B42/41] Adrenaline - Panic Counters Tiredness
description=[b]Adrenaline[/b] is a mod that adds a new mechanic to the panic and fatigue (tiredness) systems in Project Zomboid in a way that feels realistic.
description=
description=[h2]What Does It Do?[/h2]
description=[b]Adrenaline[/b] makes the [b]Panic[/b] moodle temporarily reduce your character's [b]fatigue[/b], proportional to how panicked your character is.
description=
description=This simulates an adrenaline rush, waking the character up and reducing (or even removing) the [b]Tired[/b] moodle, allowing the character to perform and fight at a higher level.
description=
description=This provides a final burst of performance out of the character before they truly require sleep, potentially allowing you to escape dire situations or secure an impromptu safehouse.
description=
description=[h2]Why?[/h2]
description=In vanilla, when the 'Drowsy' moodle appears, the character receives a whopping [b]50% damage debuff[/b], increasing to [b]80 / 90 / 95%[/b] as the character becomes more tired. (Vision and endurance are also reduced)
description=
description=Because this debuff is so large and it is applied instantaneously upon hitting 60% fatigue with no prior warning, I felt that it would be more balanced to allow the moodle to be temporarily reduced under stressful circumstances.
description=
description=[h3]However, there are limits and drawbacks:[/h3]
description=[list]
description=[*]After calming down, all the fatigue that the adrenaline took away [b](and then some)[/b], will sweep over your character, making them more tired than they were before.
description=
description=[*]Only so much fatigue can be countered by adrenaline. A ridiculously tired character will still keep their Tired moodle, even if at the max panic level.
description=
description=[*]Sleep is still a necessity. [b]Adrenaline[/b] does not change how tired your character actually is, it only disguises it up to a point.
description=
description=[*]If you go into a long, grueling fight, you might not realize you are tired until its over and calm down.
